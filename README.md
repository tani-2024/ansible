# Ansible Web Server and Database Setup

This Ansible project sets up a web server and a database server. It includes variables, loops, conditionals (`when`), handlers, and roles.

 ## Terminologies
 1. **Handlers:** Handlers are tasks that are triggered by other tasks using the notify directive.
 2. **Roles:** Roles are a way to organize and reuse Ansible tasks, handlers, variables, and other components.
 3. **Templates:** Templates are files that contain variables and logic written in Jinja2 templating language.
 4.  **ansible.cfg:** A configuration file for Ansible. It allows you to customize how Ansible behaves when you run playbooks and manage your infrastructure
